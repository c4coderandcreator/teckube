            because they will be in force thirty (30) days after we post them or
            provide you notice of them. Your only option if any change to this
            TOS is unacceptable to you is to discontinue using the Services.{" "}

            believe that the relevant Content that was removed (or to which
            access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the
            authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent,
            or pursuant to the law, to post and use such Content, you may send a

            your physical or electronic signature; identification of the content

            original complaining party informing that person that it may replace
            the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.

            against the content provider, member or user, the removed content
            may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days
            or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at TecKube’s sole
            discretion.
