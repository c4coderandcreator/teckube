            non-identifiable data whenever you interact with TecKube through the
            Services. At this time, this passively gathered information from a
            variety of technologies cannot be utilized to individually identify
            you. Such data may be kept by TecKube directly or may be present in
            databases owned and managed by the company's associates,
            representatives, or service providers. The Services might combine
            this data with other data to track things like the overall number of
            visitors to our site, how many people visit each page of our site,
            and the Internet service providers that our visitors use. Notably,
            no Personal Data is accessible to or used in this procedure.
            <br /> <br />
            We might make use of "cookies" technology to run the Services. When
            you access the Services, the computer that hosts them sends a bit of
            data to your browser called a cookie. Our cookies aid in extending
            the functionality of the Services and aid in more precise usage
            analysis. For instance, our website might place a cookie on your

            entering your password or remembering it. When we utilize cookies,
            we will never collect any personal information without your consent.
            On the toolbar of the majority of web browsers, there is a "help"
            area. For information, please refer to this section how to receive
            notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn
            cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because
            they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.

            Aggregated Personal Data: TecKube regularly performs research on its
            customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on the Personal
            Data and other information submitted to us. This research is done in
            an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
            Services. TecKube may gather and evaluate this research in

            contained in this aggregate data. In order to define our services to
            current and potential business partners as well as to other third

            aggregated user statistics.Third-Party Tracking and Analytics: After
            you use the Services, we could permit third-party service providers
            to use cookies or other similar technologies to gather data about
            your browsing habits over time and across many websites. For

            platform offered by Amplitude, Inc. ("Amplitude"), as well as Google
            Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google, Inc.
            ("Google"). In order to better understand how users, interact with
            and make use of our mobile applications and the site, Google and
            Amplitude utilize cookies and other similar technologies.

            <br /> <br />
            Business Transfers: As our company grows, we might sell or buy
            assets or other firms. Personal Data may be included in the
            transferred assets in the event of a corporate sale, merger,

            Agents, consultants, and other related third parties: TecKube, like
            many organizations, occasionally employs other businesses to carry
            out specific business-related tasks. Sending information, managing
            databases, and processing payments are a few examples of such tasks.
            When we hire another entity to carry out a task of this sort, we
            just provide them the knowledge they require to complete their
            particular task.

            Legal Requirements: If required by law or in the good faith belief
